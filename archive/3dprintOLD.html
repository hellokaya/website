                            THE STORY
                        </h4>
                        <p>3D Printing is an emerging technology that lets people design and fabricate physical objects.</p>
                        
                    <p>By analyzing digital models, 3D printers can create physical objects out of plastics, metals and other&nbsp;materials. </p>
                <p>Today, 3D printing is used to create industrial products like car and airplane parts - and by hobbyists to create household objects and crafts.</p>
                <p>Learning to 3D print is a skill that would benefit people, both personally and professionally.</p>

                    <div class="verticalSpace">

                            <p>3D printing can be expensive and confusing to new users.</p><p> Software used to create printable models can be difficult to learn, and users might not be aware of what 3D printing is used for.</p>
