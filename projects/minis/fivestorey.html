                        THE STORY
                    </h4>
                    <p>I was tasked to create album artwork for ‘The Five Storey EP’.</p>
                    <p>
                        It featured 5 songs with different moods and that told unique stories.</p>
                    <h4 class="eyebrow">THE SOLUTION</h4>

                    <h3>Custom artwork inspired by classical sculptures.
                        Each song tells a unique story, represented by a corresponding sculpture.
                    </h3>
                    <p>These sculptures are expressive and portray unique moods and stories simply through their form.
                    </p>
                    <p>They are also recognisable from their silhouettes alone.</p>

                        I created a number of sketches that could represent buildings or ‘storeys’ and storytelling at

                            Classical sculptures were ideal as they are recognisable from silhouettes.</p>
