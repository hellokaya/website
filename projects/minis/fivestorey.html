                        THE STORY
                    </h4>
                    <p>I was tasked to create album artwork for ‘The Five Storey EP’.</p>
                    <p>
                        It featured 5 songs with different moods and that told unique stories.</p>
                    <h4 class="eyebrow">THE SOLUTION</h4>

                    <h3>Custom artwork inspired by classical sculptures.
                        Each song tells a unique story, represented by a corresponding sculpture.
                    </h3>
                    <p>These sculptures are expressive and portray unique moods and stories simply through their form.
                    </p>
                    <p>They are also recognisable from their silhouettes alone.</p>

                        Research involved interviewing the artist, to learn about the inspiration behind the music. 
                    </p><p>
                        I listened to, asked about and defined the key themes expressed in each song.

                    <p>
                        I created a number of sketches that could represent buildings or ‘storeys’ and storytelling at the same time.
                    </p>

                    <p>I later developed a number of concepts from initial sketches. </p>
                    <p>These did represent storeys of a building, but lacked the human storytelling element.</p>

                        <p>This was later brought in by including silhouettes in windows of a building. 
                        </p><p>
                            Classical sculptures were ideal as they are recognisable from silhouettes.</p>
                            <p>Individual sculptures were selected to match the mood and ideas behind each song.</p>
