                <p>
                    The Writing Centre is a writing support group at Emily Carr University, and required a new website.

                    MY ROLE
                </h4>
                <p>I <b>redesigned the UX and visual design</b> of the site. 
                    </p>
                <p>I also <b>developed new features</b> for the underlying Wordpress system.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="verticalSpace">
                <h4 class="eyebrow">INSIGHTS</h4>
                <p>Research involved looking at similar websites, and <b>testing the previous site</b> with student participants.
                </p>
                <p>Testing showed the website had a number of issues, including <b>poor information organization</b> and <b>confusing visual design</b>, and needed an all-round update.</p>
