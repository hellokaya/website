                    MY ROLE
                </h4>
                <p>I worked on <b>Product design and UX design</b> for the game. </p>
                <p>I worked on <b>wireframing and interactions</b>, <b>writing copy</b>, and on <b>promotional
                        materials</b>.
                </p>
                <p>I also took part in <b>making key decisions on the functionality and mechanics</b> of the game. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="verticalSpace">
                <h4 class="eyebrow">PROJECT GOALS</h4>
                <p>EQ is based off the surrealist game Exquisite Corpse. This involves players <b>making art based on
                        cropped parts of other players’ drawings</b>.
                </p>
                <p>This leads to <b>unique and surreal creations</b>, like in the picture above.</p>
                <p>Mobil Art School aimed to <b>bring this experience to mobile</b>.
                </p>
                <p>This enables <b>unique drawing canvas arrangements</b>, and <b>online collaboration</b> with players
                    around the world. </p>
