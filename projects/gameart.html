                            THE STORY
                        </h4>
                        <p>The Game Art university course can be intimidating. <br>
                            Students taking this course learn to create high-quality 3D models and artwork for
                            games.</p>
                        <p>The course was previously advertised by showing off examples of high-quality work by
                            more
                            advanced students.</p>

                    <div class="verticalSpace">
                        <h4 class="eyebrow">THE CHALLENGE</h4>

                            <p>User research showed that potential students generally only knew the basics of art
                                before
                                joining the course.</p>
                            <p>Potential students were not sure if they had the skill to create the high-quality
                                models shown
                                in promotional&nbsp;materials.</p>
