                    THE STORY
                </h4>
                <p>The Game Art university course can be intimidating. <br>
                    Students taking this course learn to create high-quality 3D models and artwork for
                    games.</p>
                <p>The course was previously advertised by showing off examples of high-quality work by
                    more
                    advanced students.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="verticalSpace">
                    <h4 class="eyebrow">THE CHALLENGE</h4>

                    <p>User research showed that potential students generally only knew the basics of art
                        before
                        joining the course.</p>
                    <p>Potential students were not sure if they had the skill to create the high-quality
                        models shown
                        in promotional&nbsp;materials.</p>

        <h2 class="limitWidth">
            <ul>
                <li>Promotional material that is not intimidating to audiences unfamiliar with game art.</li>

                <li>Promotional material that bridges the gap between what the reader knows and what they will
                    learn on the&nbsp;course.</li>
